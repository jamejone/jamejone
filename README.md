# Hi, I'm James ðŸ‘‹

Pronouns: he/him

## Welcome to my GitHub profile

I'm a software developer based out of Durham, NC, where I work remotely on Instagram's content quality platform. While that keeps me pretty busy, I occasionally carve out some time for hobby projects, like those that I contribute to here on GitHub.

## Side project #1: [Nesteggly.com](https://www.nesteggly.com)

Capitalizing on my time in the financial sector, Nesteggly offers a unique way of thinking about retirement planning in which you embrace the volality of your portfolio. This project is built with Jekyll, Webpack and Vue.

## Side project #2: [w8lifting.app](https://w8lifting.app)

w8lifting.app is a simple, customizable weightlifting journal which I use to track my powerlifting routine. Utilizing PWA technology powered by Nuxt, it's capable of working fully offline.

## Side project #3: [So Long, and Thanks For All the Bits](https://blog.cumulosoftware.com/)

My technical blog where I write about various tech topics in long form. This project is powered by Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

## How to reach me ðŸ“«

These days, the best way to get my attention is to give me a shout on social media via [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mrjonze) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/james_output).

If you must, you can also reach me by email at james dot russel dot jones at gmail dot com, but we warned that your message may vanish into the ether that is my inbox, never to be seen.
