# Hi, I'm James

Check out some of my side projects.

## [Cooltech](https://coolte.ch)

I design and sell computer 'frames' -- like a cross between a case and a test bench.

## [Nesteggly.com](https://www.nesteggly.com)

Financial calculators and opinions informed by my career in the financial sector. This project is built with Jekyll, Webpack and Vue.

## [w8lifting.app](https://w8lifting.app)

w8lifting.app is a simple, customizable weightlifting journal which I use to track my powerlifting routine. Utilizing PWA technology powered by Nuxt, it's capable of working fully offline.

## [So Long, and Thanks For All the Bits](https://jamejone.github.io/)

My neglected blog :') This site is powered by Jekyll and GitHub Pages.
