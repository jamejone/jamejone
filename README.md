# Hi, I'm James ðŸ‘‹

## Welcome to my GitHub profile

I'm a software developer based out of Durham, NC, where I work remotely on Instagram's content quality platform. While that keeps me pretty busy, I occasionally carve out some time for hobby projects like those that I contribute to here on GitHub.

## Side project #1: [Nesteggly.com](https://www.nesteggly.com)

Having spent most of my career working in finance (including several years working on Schwab's robo advisor), Nesteggly offers a unique way of thinking about retirement planning in which you embrace the volality of your portfolio. This project is built with Jekyll, Webpack and Vue.

## Side project #2: [w8lifting.app](https://w8lifting.app)

w8lifting.app is a simple, customizable weightlifting journal which I use to track my powerlifting routine. Utilizing PWA technology powered by Nuxt, it's capable of working fully offline. The state of the application is always synchronized to the local storage of your device, so you never need to worry about 'saving' your data.

## Side project #3: [So Long, and Thanks For All the Bits](https://blog.cumulosoftware.com/)

My technical blog where I write about various tech topics in long form.

## How to reach me ðŸ“«

These days, the best way to get my attention give me a shout on social media via [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mrjonze) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/james_output).

If you must, you can also reach me by email at james dot russel dot jones at gmail dot com, but we warned that I may not see your message.
